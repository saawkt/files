Output Files

    FrameView generates two output files:
        FrameView_<Application exe name>_YYYY_MM_DDTHHMMSS_Log.csv - contains per frame data
        FrameView_Summary.csv - contains aggregate statistics
    
    Notes:
       1. If you have an existing summary file and log file, it is recommended that you rename/delete or move it to a new location before using FrameView.
       2. If you have already generated summary file, it will be updated in the next benchmark only if you have closed the existing summary file.

Exclusion List
    To exclude an application from showing the overlay, add an entry to ExcludeList.overlay.txt file (found in Drive > ProgramData(hidden item) > NVIDIA Corporation > FrameView)
    To exclude a process for logging e.g. unwanted logs for browser running in the background, add an entry to ExcludeList.txt file (found in Drive > ProgramData(hidden item) > NVIDIA Corporation > FrameView)

Settings 
    Settings.ini has knobs to toggle features ON/OFF. Only toggle settings listed below.
    FPSOverlayDispMode              Bitmask (accepts both hex or decimal)
                                    0x800 - Enable per CPU core/thread utilization
    Note: For FrameView 1.3, Settings.ini would get overwritten during installation for a smooth update experience and hence user settings wouldn't be retained.

* Enabling "Scanout Color Bar" will impact performance marginally.
